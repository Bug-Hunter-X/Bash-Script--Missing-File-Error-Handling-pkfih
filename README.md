# Bash Scripting Bug: Missing File Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with files. The `bug.sh` script attempts to read a file without checking if the file exists.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and script failure.

The `bugSolution.sh` script shows the corrected version with appropriate error handling using exit codes.
